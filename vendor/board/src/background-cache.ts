/**
 * What an uploaded background's bytes are, once, for whoever is drawing.
 *
 * A saved background keeps its image in storage rather than in the pitch
 * style, so anything drawing a board from markup, the Boards cards, the
 * Projects strip and the animation player alike, has to read it. Reading is
 * asynchronous and drawing is not, so this holds the answer: the first ask
 * starts one read and returns nothing, every ask after it is answered from
 * memory, and what arrives calls back so the view can draw again.
