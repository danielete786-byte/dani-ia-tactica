/**
 * Where the board talks to Tactics Journal.
 *
 * The board is a separate site. Its board APIs stay on the current Board host;
 * only account, entitlement, and checkout calls cross to Tactics Journal. That
 * account origin was once hardcoded in several places, which made a preview
 * build untestable. It read production's session and sent buyers to production's
 * checkout, so a sandbox purchase could never be seen from a preview board.
 *
 * A preview build points at the billing sandbox instead. Production is the
 * default and the fallback: an unrecognised host, or any failure reading the
 * build context, resolves to the real site rather than to a sandbox that would
 * quietly show the wrong entitlements.
